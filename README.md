# google-homepage
replica of the google homepage, exercise in html and css

finished on June 7 2020. Not perfect, but stopped at the point when I felt like I had learned what I could.

CSS for the results page feels a bit hacky -- result of not enough planning beforehand, what to wrap in divs, etc. 

Need further practice in inheritance (I used classes and ids for almost everything which led to repeated code)

Need further practice in setting up the main structure - I had problems keeping the footer at the bottom of the page, and had to hard code the wrapper height.

The google logo at the bottom is a shortcut.
